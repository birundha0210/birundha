# âœ… Server Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The login page was showing a server error because **MongoDB was not installed or running** on your system. When you tried to login/register, the backend couldn't connect to the database.

## What I Fixed

I installed and configured **MongoDB Memory Server** - an in-memory MongoDB that runs automatically without requiring you to install MongoDB separately.

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed `mongodb-memory-server`** package
   - This creates a temporary MongoDB in memory
   - Perfect for development and testing
   - No installation or setup needed!

2. **Updated database configuration** (`backend/src/config/database.ts`)
   - Automatically detects if local MongoDB is available
   - Falls back to in-memory MongoDB if not
   - Works instantly without any configuration

3. **Updated `.env` file** with helpful comments
   - Shows both local and cloud MongoDB options
   - Easy to switch to real MongoDB later if needed

## Current Status

âœ… **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000  
âœ… **Frontend App**: Running on http://localhost:5173  
âœ… **Database**: In-Memory MongoDB (Auto-started)  
âœ… **Login/Register**: Now working perfectly!

## How to Use Now

1. **Click the preview browser button** to view the app
2. **Register a new account** - it will work now!
3. **Login** with your credentials
4. **Create tickets** and test all features

## Important Notes

### About In-Memory Database

- **Data is temporary**: All data is lost when you restart the server
- **Perfect for testing**: Great for development and learning
- **No installation needed**: Works out of the box
- **Fast and reliable**: Ideal for rapid development

### Want Permanent Data?

If you want your data to persist between restarts, you have two options:

**Option 1: Install MongoDB Locally**
```bash
# Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
# Then update backend/.env:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ticket-system
```

**Option 2: Use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Free)**
```bash
# Create account at: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
# Get connection string and update backend/.env:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ticket-system
```

See `MONGODB_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## Test the Application

Try these steps to verify everything works:

1. âœ… Register with email and password
2. âœ… Login with your credentials
3. âœ… View the dashboard
4. âœ… Create a new ticket
5. âœ… Add comments to tickets
6. âœ… Update ticket status (if agent/admin)

All features should work perfectly now! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

- The application is fully functional
- Create multiple users with different roles
- Test all features (tickets, comments, filtering)
- Enjoy your support ticketing system!
