# ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

## âœ… Error Fixed!

The error you saw was because you tried to run `npm` commands from the root directory, but the actual code is in `backend/` and `frontend/` subdirectories.

**I've fixed this by creating a root package.json with helpful scripts!**

---

## Quick Start (Easiest Way)

Now you can run the entire application from the root directory with one command!

### Option 1: Run Both Servers at Once (Recommended)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend and frontend simultaneously!

### Option 2: Run Servers Separately

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

## Available Commands (From Root Directory)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start both backend & frontend |
| `npm run dev:backend` | Start backend only |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Start frontend only |
| `npm run install:all` | Install all dependencies |
| `npm run build:all` | Build both projects |

---

## Alternative: Run from Subdirectories

If you prefer to work in individual folders:

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Current Application Status

âœ… **Backend**: Port 5000  
âœ… **Frontend**: Port 5173  
âœ… **Database**: In-Memory MongoDB (auto-starts)  
âœ… **All Dependencies**: Installed

## Next Steps

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Or click the preview button

3. **Test the app:**
   - Register a new account
   - Login and create tickets
   - Enjoy!
